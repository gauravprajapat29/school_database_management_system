# School Database Management System

The School Database Management System is a Python-based application with a graphical user interface (GUI) implemented using the Tkinter module. It aims to efficiently manage various aspects of student and teacher information within a school setting. The project utilizes the pymysql library to handle database operations.

Key Features:
1. **New Student Joining Panel**: This panel enables the registration of new students by allowing the insertion of their data into the database. Students' information, including roll number, name, gender, class, contact, date of birth (DOB), and address, can be recorded.

2. **Registered Students Fee Panel**: The fee panel facilitates the management of student fees. It provides a platform to track and handle fee-related information for registered students. This includes tracking payment status, due dates, and generating fee-related reports.

3. **Class Teacher Panel**: The Class Teacher Panel provides relevant functionalities for teachers. Teachers can access and manage student-related data, such as attendance, grades, and performance metrics. This allows teachers to monitor their students' academic progress effectively.

4. **Principal Panel**: The Principal Panel serves as an administrative interface, providing access to critical information and tools for school management. The principal can view overall student statistics, teacher performance, and other important school-related data.

5. **Data Retrieval Functionality**: The project implements data retrieval functionality, allowing users to display and access student and teacher data stored within the system. This enables easy visualization and management of relevant information.

The School Database Management System project aims to enhance the efficiency and organization of school-related tasks and data management. With its user-friendly GUI, teachers and administrators can easily input, access, and analyze student information, leading to better decision-making and improved school operations.
